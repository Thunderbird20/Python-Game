# Preview

This file provides a quick preview of the game's look and feel, gameplay,
and primary UX flows.

Short description
- A small, focused Python game that can run in console mode or with a simple
  Pygame graphical frontend. The gameplay loop centers on a player character
  navigating levels, collecting items, and avoiding enemies.

Gameplay highlights
- Short sessions (2–10 minutes) per level.
- Increasing difficulty with new enemy types and faster obstacles.
- Collectibles unlock simple cosmetics or level shortcuts.

Example run (console-mode placeholder)

```
Welcome to Python Game!
Level 1: Forest
Lives: 3  Score: 0
Use WASD or arrow keys to move. Press Space to interact.
```

Graphical preview
- If the project uses Pygame, the window typically shows a top-down or
  side-scrolling view, sprite-based characters, and HUD elements for health
  and score. Placeholders for screenshots live in `assets/previews/` if
  provided.

Who is this for?
- Players who enjoy short, replayable levels and simple mechanics.
- Developers looking for a small codebase to extend (new levels, enemies,
  or UI features).

Notes
- Add screenshots or GIFs to `assets/previews/` and link them from this file
  for a richer preview.
