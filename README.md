# Python Game

A small, extensible Python game project with clear documentation for players
and contributors. This repository contains the game source plus a complete set
of documentation files in the `docs/` folder that describe installation,
usage, controls, development, and contribution guidelines.

**Key Links**
- Docs: [docs/](docs/)

## Features
- Simple, portable Python game core (console or Pygame-based depending on
  implementation).
- Easy to run locally with `pip` and a `requirements.txt`.
- Guidance for contributors: code style, testing, and pull request process.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:

	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

2. Run the game (example):

	```bash
	python -m src.main
	```

3. See full instructions in [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) and
[docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## Project Layout

- `assets/` — images, audio, and other game assets.
- `docs/` — detailed documentation (installation, usage, controls, contributing).
- `requirements.txt` — minimal Python dependencies.
